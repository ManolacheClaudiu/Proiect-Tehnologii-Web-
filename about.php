                Our web application is not meant to be a tool for working in big projects. 
                We consider our application a good tool for learning and to be easy to use by students.
                If we would compare our application functionalities with other big platforms like GitHub,
                our one is not meant to used in professional purpose. It can be used just to personal purpose, 
                to share code easily to someones, or to keep your code for a while. Our application does not assume
                the privacy of the users code.

                        save it and the share to whoever he wish.
                        Another usability comes from the ones who want to help the others with their code, by posting it public 
                        and inspiring anothers. If the user consider his code having issues, he can easely put it in private mode, if he is logged in.
                        The product has the purpose to bring an easy to use environment, designed in dark colors, to protect as much we can the eyes,

                        The user could post his source code by pasting it in the textarea from the main page. After he decided about its valability and its visibility, 
                        he can save it as public and share is as a link, or select the colaborators to which he wants to share the source code.
                        As an logged in user, he can manage his code, which is the left side of main page: he can edit it or simply delete it.

                If we would compare our application functionalities with other big platforms like GitHub,
                our one is not meant to used in professional purpose. It can be used just to personal purpose,

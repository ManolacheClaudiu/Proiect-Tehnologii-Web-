                    for a set amount of time. The source code could be considered as text or as code in Html, Css, Java, C and C++.
                    It can be used by an unlogged user, but the logged one has more functionalities.
                </p>

                    PasteIt is an web application, easy to use, designed to be helpfull to the ones which want to
                    share their source code with anothers or to have it on another device.
                    The user does not need to much instructions: the application is intuitive: click on it, paste your code,
                    save it and the share to whoever he wish.
                    Another usability comes from the ones who want to help the others with their code, by posting it public 
                    and inspiring anothers. If the user consider his code having issues, he can easely put it in private mode, if he is logged in.

                    Meant to be easy to use, the application doesn't have a lot of functionalities and it makes it even faster.
                    The user could post his source code by pasting it in the textarea from the main page. After he decided about its valability and its visibility, 
                    he can save it as public and share is as a link, or select the colaborators to which he wants to share the source code.
                    As an logged in user, he can manage his code, which is the left side of main page: he can edit it or simply delete it.

               Our web application is not meant to be a tool for working in big projects. 
               We consider our application a good tool for learning and to be easy to use by students.
               If we would compare our application functionalities with other big platforms like GitHub,
               our one is not meant to used in professional purpose. It can be used just to personal purpose, 
               to share code easily to someones, or to keep your code for a while. Our application does not assume
              the privacy of the users code.

                The PasteIt application provides simply options which can help the user to share his code.
                A logged user has the option to make his code visibility from public to private, while the unlogged one has the code by default public. 
                The logged user has also the option to set the time exposure and set a password, in case he wants to share to code just to someones.
                Furthermore, he can add colaborators which can edit his code, but you will be able to see the precedent version.
